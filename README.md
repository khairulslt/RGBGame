# RGB Game


### Introduction

* Main File: colorGame.html
* Built with Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp
* A (soon-to-be web) application where users play a color guessing game 
* Users are given a Color Combination of Red, Green Blue, (R, G, B) in that order to help them guess


### Improvements
* Cleaned up code 
* Change shape of palette(grid squares) and color of stripes
* Trying to deploy on subdomain of khairulslt.me (rgbgame.khairulslt.me)
* But Nginx and Digital Ocean got the better of me :(
